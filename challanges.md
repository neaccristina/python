- syntax
       -> given that it is a new language for me I have used plenty of google to research most of it .I am positive that in the near future I will be able to come to the point where I can do everything much easier and by heart, without using google as much. 
       -> indentation- coming from an Oracle background the only issue encountered was with not aligning properly my code, and the fact that it became unreadable and hard to decode.
       -> Python 2 to Python 3 translate	  
- regular expressions-> needed improvement but nothing that a bit of Google couldn't fix. 
- list comprehensions-> initially challenging for me to read/write when it came to several nested loops.	
- more reading needed on methods since I basically used add/append/extend/remove for lists and the variety is really broad.
- I noticed you can do a lot with built in functions so it's always worth to research first
- the same with modules - used basically a few methods from os, re, time and there are so many more exciting things out there  
- classes and oop in general->still a lot more reading from my side needed, big topic that definitely needs more practice
- more practice on input/output
- more practice on unit testing.
- "Magics"-> really useful things that needs more practice and for which it's worth knowing all the tools that it encapsulates, as they can get really handy.
- Used mostly the Python IDLE , and running from terminal, but I also installed Pycharm which on this occasion I didn't end up using
- Overall I became really comfortable with Python after each day of reading materials and practice, and although the task was quite simple I was and still am very excited to research as many aspects of the program as possible
